Duplicator 6 Firmware - Marlin 1.1.0-RC8 by dot_bob (Robert Mendon)
Release Notes

Background:

Being an embedded linux kernel developer myself and being tired of the limited features of the stock firmware
I decided to make my own port of the Marlin firmware.  My goal was to make the firmware as vanilla as possible allowing
future ports to mainline to be quick and simple.  For the desciription of changes see notes below.

Usage:

If you are stock Duplicator 6 compile as is.  Use the Aduino Software IDE and add the U8glib graphics library to compile and load the firmware.

Changes:

Version 1.1.0-RC8 01-23-17 (Initial Release) Version 3
- Added LED lighting setting to EEPROM.
- Added LED dimming setting to the Control Menu.
- Added confirm to stop print when printing with sd card.
- Fixed a bug in the stop print function by adding code to shutdown the hotend and heatbed.
- Added the ability to adjust stepper driver current from the Control -> Motion lcd menu.
- Added auto leveling grid positions from marlin development repository.
- Changed menu selection from hollow box to inverted text.
- Changed the menu beep from 100ms to 5ms.
- Updated Conditionals_post.h so the #define XXXXXX_PROBE_BED_POSITION statements are no longer needed .
- Enabled the LCD info menu.
- Changed the move axis menu to select the axis first and distance second.
- Relocated the move axis menu item to the top of the prepare menu.  
- Added filament change option to the prepare menu.

Version 1.1.0-RC8 01-16-17 (Initial Release) Version 2
- Fixed many display issues and improved responsiveness.
- Added Support for the LED light
- Added adjusting stepper driver currents with command M907 and saving in EEPROM and supported in commands M500, M502, M503;
- Removed Babystep for X and Y axis.

Version 1.1.0-RC8 01-16-17 (Initial Release) Version 1
- Increased the display menu timeout from 15 seconds to two minutes by changing the line "#define LCD_TIMEOUT_TO_STATUS 15000"
to "#define LCD_TIMEOUT_TO_STATUS 120000" in the file ultralcd.h.
- Added "Babystep Z" to the Main Menu when performing a print.  This allows the user to quickly access the the realtime z height ajustment.
